= University of Edinburgh School of GeoSciences setup scripts for LSDTopoTools

This repository houses scripts for setting up https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools2[LSDTopoTools] and https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDMappingTools[LSDMappingTools] on a University of Edinbirgh School of GeoSciences server. 

WARNING: These scripts only work if you are at the University of Edinburgh and have a University of Edinburgh Username. If that does not apply to you, you might be able to adapt these scripts for your organisation, but they are not meant to be general. 

This repository currently has two scripts:

* `LSDTT_UEdin_setup.sh`: This sets up the main *LSDTopoTools* programs. It also grabs some example data. 
* `LSDMT_UEdin_setup.sh`: This sets up the python environment for *LSDMappingTools* using conda.
